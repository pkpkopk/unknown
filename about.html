					Friendship is a simple word but carries a deep meaning. It cannot be defined by a single phrase or a paragraph as it means different things to different people but to me friendship means being there for each other. Not only sharing in joys but sorrows as well. Friendship is one of the most precious gifts of life. A true friend is the one who u can blindly trust, the one who you can rely on, any time of the day.

                    There's no particular time when one will find a true friend. Friendship has no bar of caste, religion or social status it's more like two people meet irrespective of anything and they just happen to have the best time of their live when they are together. Everything with a friend seems to fun. True friendship lasts till death and does not fluctuate from time to time. The essential qualities of good friends are trustworthiness , loyalty and honesty. They are good listeners.They Â pay close attention to what you are saying. They easily forgive us for our mistakes. Most importantly, good friend value our presence in their life. Good friends are hard to find , harder to leave and impossible to forget.

				<h3>What We Do</h3>
				<p>Given that student work results directly from the philosophy, design, and goals of an academic program, from the lessons developed by teachers, and from the type and quality of instruction students receive, the characteristics of student work will inevitably change when schools or instructional strategies change.
